The 7 day roguelike challenge has been and gone for this year, and my participation in it can be summed up in a few words:

`Not enough time.`

More specifically, I didn't have the time available to dedicate to it. I thought the commute time would be enough, but between working, travelling and spending time with my family, there wasn't much time left for building a roguelike.

It wasn't a complete failure though, the game progressed a fair way, and I learned a lot in the process.

**SpyRL features**

The features that were completed in SpyRL include

* Title screen
* Help screen
* Main game screen
* System for displaying messages to the user
* Move around the world
* Open and close doors
* Search containers
* Take items from containers
* Drop what you're currently carrying
* Attack an enemy in melee combat
* Lose health
* Enemies move randomly
* Enemies attack anyone who moves adjacent to them

There are a bunch of things missing, such as win and lose states, and traps, that I will add into the game in the future.

**What I learned**

* The delve library is missing 2 key features, FoV and Pathing
* Other than above, delve is quite usable. The component system works surprisingly well
* My rendering code needs some work. The game gets slower at larger console sizes
* SpyRL could turn out to be a fun game, I should finish it.
* Next year I could plan to take some time off to work on the game.

I won't be releasing either Delve or Spyrl to [Rubygems](http://rubygems.org) just yet. Spyrl isn't either winnable or losable at the moment, and delve probably needs a FoV feature as well as an A* implementation before it's ready to be used in the wild.
