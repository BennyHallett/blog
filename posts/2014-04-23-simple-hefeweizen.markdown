German style wheat beers are some of my favourite beers to drink. I fell in love Hofbrau when I was over in Munich for Oktoberfest, and I've tried a few different beers over the last year.

This is my first attempt at creating a wheat beer, so I wanted to use a simple recipe that could be expanded on into the future.
