## Projects I've contributed to

* **[Jekyll Compose](http://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-compose)** - a plugin to
  add composition commands to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site
generator written in [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org). I initially created the
commands as extensions to Jekyll itself, but it was decided that the changes
would work better as a plugin. Unfortunately I'd moved onto [my own
projects](/projects.html) before changes were merged in, and I no longer
contribute to this project.
