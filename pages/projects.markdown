## Projects I maintain


* **[Obelisk](http://github.com/bennyhallett/obelisk)** - a static site
generator built using [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org). It supports several
standard static site concepts such as frontmatter, x and themes. It comes
bundled with the [Cowboy](https://hex.pm/packages/cowboy) web server. Obelisk
is used to build this site.
* **[Anubis](http://github.com/bennyhallett/anubis)** - a command line
  applicaiton framework for [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org). Although mix has
the capability to handle multiple commands for a single tool, Anubis is designed
to be used when compiling a program to an escript.
