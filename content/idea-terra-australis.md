Summary: My initial ideas about a survival roguelike based in pre-colonised Australia

I've been playing a lot of [Cataclysm DDA](http://en.cataclysmdda.com) lately, and have been enjoying the survival aspect of it. Right from the start you're in life-threatening danger, which requires a lot more strategy and planning than a typical hack-and-slash roguelike.

Right now I'm also listening to the [Roguelike Radio](http://www.roguelikeradio.com/2013/09/this-is-episode-80-of-roguelike-radio.html) episode on [Unreal World](http://www.unrealworld.fi). Unreal World is a survival roguelike set in Iron Age Finland. I like the idea that it's not set in a fantasy world, which has been done over a million times by now. The health/death system sounds a lot like the [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves) system, where you don't have health points as such, but you can get injured in various ways. These injuries may or may not be life threatening, and can have effects on your characters ability to perform different actions.

This gave me the idea of creating a survival roguelike based on the Australian environment right before it was colonised by the British.

The time and location could be interesting for a survival roguelike for a lot of reasons:

* The environment is harsh. There is a meme currently that everything in Australia is out to kill you. There is some truth to that; there are a lot of dangerous creatures around here.
* An interesting culture with their own fantasy and lore.
* Small, nomadic communities with their alliances would make for a great world to explore.

Mechanic ideas
==============

* Typical roguelike permadeath.
* An age system. You can die of old age, which should be an extremely difficult goal to achieve. As you get older, you should get injured easier and become slower.
* A crafting system, where you can make boomerangs, spears, woomeras.
* British, Dutch and Islander explorers that you can meet.
* A tribal faction diplomacy system. Each tribe should form and break alliances with each other, which you can participate in.
* Some mild fantasy based on the lore of the time.
