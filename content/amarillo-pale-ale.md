Summary: My first non-kit extract beer, brewed with Northern-Brewer and Amarillo hops.

If you're just starting out in Homebrewing, you may have bought yourself a homebrew kit from your local home brew store, or maybe a large chain store. My advice would be, don't follow the instructions on the can of malt you get. 

Ok maybe the first time you brew, use the can and follow the instructions. You've got the kit there, and it'll be beer none the less.

However before you set off to do your second brew, read [John Palmer's amazing, free, online book, How To Brew](http://howtobrew.com). It started me on the track to actually crafting beers, rather than just re-creating a soulless, store-bought one.

This beer is the first beer I've ever brewed by boiling malt extract, and adding hops according to a schedule. I had an idea about the type of beer I wanted to make. I'm really loving bitter, heavily hopped pale ales at the moment, so I decided to try and create my own.

After looking for recipes online, I took my ideas to my local homebrew store, and with some recommendations from the brewer there, came up with the following recipe.
