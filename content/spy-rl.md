Summary: Roguelike idea: A roguelike version of Spy vs Spy

I'm sitting at the train station, waiting for my massively delayed train, listening to the Roguelike Radio podcast. 

I'm listening about how to create a good 7 day roguelike, and the examples that the hosts are presenting are giving me a fair few ideas. One that really struck me was a roguelike interpretation of the old Spy vs Spy game.

Some ideas that I have about the game include:

* Psuedo-randomly generated levels.
* Multiple floors.
* Rooms contain items from the original game, such as doors, chests, cupboards, and pictures
* The goal of the game is to collect several items hidden throughout the world, and then escape.
* The world may contain more than two spies.
* Would you be able to include permadeath?

I'm not sure I'll ever get around to implementing this game, but it seems like it might be a simple one to implement, so it might be a good fit for a game jam.
