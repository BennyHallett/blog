Joe's Ancient Orange mead is a simple beginners mead, which takes only 20 minutes to make.

I first heard about mead when browsing the [Aussie Home Brewer](http://aussiehomebrewer.com) non-beer forum. Having never tried mead before, I purchased a bottle of Maxwell Mead. It has an interesting taste. It's fairly sweet, and initially reminded me of port. For me, it's best served slightly warm.

I used [this JAO mead recipe](http://aussiehomebrewer.com/topic/32762-jao-the-ultimate-beginners-mead-recipe/) to create my batch. It was quite simple to make, and fairly inexpensive. I used some standard Australian honey from the supermarket, but the recipe could be improved by using fresh, locally sourced honey.


Recipe
======

**Recipe Volume**: 5L

**Yeast**: 1 tsp Tandaco bread yeast

**Fermentables**: 1.6kg honey

**Calculated Original Gravity**: Unknown

**Hop additions**: None

**Other additions**: 

* 1 Cinnimon stick
* 25 raisins
* 1 orange, cut into 8ths
* 1 clove

**Procedure**:

* Mark off 3.8L on the side of the 5L demijohn.
* Clean and sterilize the demijohn
* Dissolve the honey in warm water, and pour into the demijohn
* Wash the orange to remove any pesiticides. Cut it into 8 slices, and place in the demijohn (skin and all)
* Add 25 raisins to the demijohn, as well as the clove and cinnimon stick.
* Fill with water to the 3.8L mark you made earlier.
* Close the demijohn with the lid or a bung, and shake well to aerate the mixture.
* Wait until the mixture returns to room temperature, then pitch 1tsp of bread yeast.
* After 3 or 4 days, top up with water to make 5L.

**Fermentation**:

Try to leave the demijohn in a cool, dry location. A kitchen cupboard would work well. As per the instructions on the original thread, once it's fermenting, don't touch it. Leave it for a couple of months, waiting for the mixture to clear on it's own. 

**Results**:

Awaiting fermentation to complete.
