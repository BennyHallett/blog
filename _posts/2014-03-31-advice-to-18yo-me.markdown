As I come up on 10 years studying and practicing software engineering, I've been reflecting on where I am in my career, and how I could have done things differently.




**ideas**

* Learn new languages (and new paradigms)
* Start contributing to open source early
* Pay more attention in Uni class. That OO stuff that you thought you know all about? It's going to be super important to you.
* Spend more time actually at Uni, with other people in your course.
* Change jobs every two to three years.
