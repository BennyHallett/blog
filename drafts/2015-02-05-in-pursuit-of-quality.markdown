What is quality?

In Zen and the art of motorcucle maintenance, the author explores this.

He says it is undefinable.

It splits the gap between classic and romantic, hip and square.

Thinking about it from a software dev perspective.

Tests..... can be a technique used to aid quality, but having them doesn't
ensure quality.

I think its somewhat subjective. What one quality means for one thing isnt the
same as others.

I think what it boils down to is that things that have quality were created (or
designed perhaps) by people who cared about them.

Thinking about ironing my shirt this morning. I cared more, so I put more effort
into making sure it looked of a high quality...
